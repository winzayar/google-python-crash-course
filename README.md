# google-python-crash-course
This is my code portfolio for "Crash Course on Python," the first course in Google's IT Automation Certificate. It's organized by module and includes solutions demonstrating my proficiency in Python fundamentals, from basic syntax to OOP. It serves as a practical record of my ability to write, debug, and automate tasks.
