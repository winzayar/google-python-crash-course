## 📜 Course Summary

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to Python programming, designed for beginners with no prior experience. It is the first of six courses in the **[Google IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-automation)**. The curriculum covers everything from basic syntax and data structures to object-oriented programming (OOP) and culminates in a final project.

## 🚀 Skills Gained

By completing this course, I gained practical experience in:

* **Programming Fundamentals:** Writing scripts, debugging, and computational thinking.
* **Python Syntax:** Understanding variables, data types, functions, and conditional logic (`if/elif/else`).
* **Control Flow:** Using `while` and `for` loops to iterate and automate tasks.
* **Data Structures:** Working with Lists, Dictionaries, and Tuples to store and manipulate data.
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Building and managing code using Classes, Methods, and Inheritance.
* **Code Reusability:** Importing and using Python modules.

## 🗂 Repository Structure

This repository is organized by the course's weekly modules. Each folder contains the corresponding quizzes, practice exercises, and scripts I wrote.

* ### `/Week 1 - Hello Python/`
    * **Topics:** Introduction to programming, Python syntax, functions (`print()`, `type()`), and arithmetic operations.

* ### `/Week 2 - Basic Python Syntax/`
    * **Topics:** Data types, variables, conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `elif`), and defining/calling functions.

* ### `/Week 3 - Loops/`
    * **Topics:** `while` and `for` loops, `range()`, and common loop errors.

* ### `/Week 4 - Strings, Lists, and Dictionaries/`
    * **Topics:** Advanced string manipulation (indexing, slicing, formatting), list methods, and dictionary operations.

* ### `/Week 5 - Object-Oriented Programming/`
    * **Topics:** Defining classes and methods, object instances, inheritance, and importing Python modules.

* ### `/Week 6 - Final Project - Word Cloud/`
    * **Project:** A final script that applies all the concepts from the course. This script reads a text file, counts the frequency of each word, and generates a "word cloud" image.
